# Guided UAVs and Drones for Line Inspection 

# Introduction

Guided Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs), also known as drones, are revolutionizing the inspection and maintenance of linear infrastructure like power lines, pipelines, and railways. Traditionally, such inspections required labor-intensive and hazardous methods such as helicopters or manual climbing. Guided UAVs are programmed to autonomously follow predefined routes using GPS, sensors, and AI technologies to capture high-quality data, making the inspection process safer, faster, and more cost-effective.

# Formulas with Real-Time Applications

 # Here are some key formulas used in UAV operations and line inspection tasks:

  # A. UAV Flight Time Estimation
  
Flight Time (min) = Battery Capacity (mAh) × Voltage (V) × 60 / Power Consumption (W) × 1000

​
🔹 Application: Helps in planning drone missions for long-distance line inspections.


🔹 Example: If a drone has a 6000mAh battery, 14.8V, and consumes 200W:


 Flight Time = 6000 × 14.8 × 60 / 200 × 1000 =≈ 26.6 minutes

  # B. Image Overlap for Line Mapping
  
 Overlap = Image Width ×(1−Side Overlap %) / Ground Coverage Width
​
🔹 Application: Ensures continuous and complete imaging of power lines

  # C. Thermal Anomaly Detection

  Δ𝑇 =𝑇 defect − 𝑇 ambient

🔹 Application: Used in detecting overheated connectors or damaged insulators using thermal cameras.
