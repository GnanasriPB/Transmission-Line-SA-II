# Guided UAVs and Drones for Line Inspection 

# Introduction

Guided Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs), also known as drones, are revolutionizing the inspection and maintenance of linear infrastructure like power lines, pipelines, and railways. Traditionally, such inspections required labor-intensive and hazardous methods such as helicopters or manual climbing. Guided UAVs are programmed to autonomously follow predefined routes using GPS, sensors, and AI technologies to capture high-quality data, making the inspection process safer, faster, and more cost-effective.

# Key Features of Guided UAVs for Line Inspection

 #  Autonomous Navigation

Pre-programmed flight paths using GPS/RTK.

Enables precise and repeatable inspections without manual piloting.
